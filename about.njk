    <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Blake.</h2>
    <p>
      After taking a spontaneous half-year trip to Japan and Korea, I uprooted my life in Los Angeles and made Tokyo my base.
      From there, I've explored the hidden temples of Kyoto, bustling markets of Bangkok, and cobblestone streets of Europe.
      My passion is planning flexible, cost-conscious itineraries that balance iconic sights with off-the-beaten-path experiences.
      I use detailed spreadsheets not to box myself in, but to leave room for serendipity—so you can pivot at
      a moment’s notice and discover unexpected adventures.
      Through my photography and travel writing, I aim to inspire curiosity, empathy, and a deeper connection with the world.
      Let’s explore together.
