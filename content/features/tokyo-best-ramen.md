### 🍜 Taishoken Eifukucho

Taishoken’s legendary shoyu ramen was the first bowl that truly made me fall in love with Japanese noodles.  
The broth has a mellow soy flavor with a hint of citrus from lemon peel, while the noodles come in hearty portions.  
I always add extra menma (bamboo shoots)—trust me, it’s worth it.  
Expect old-school vibes and classical music filling the cozy dining room.

### 🔥 Kikanbo Ramen

Kikanbo is for spice lovers.  
Their karashibi miso ramen brings serious heat with fiery red peppers and tongue-tingling numb peppers.  
Each bite of their thick, juicy chashu pork soaks up the bold broth.  
Pro move: order the *Tokusei* ramen and ask for extra spice if you dare.

### 🐉 Toraibu Ramen

Deep in Jiyugaoka, Toraibu serves up classic Yokohama-style (*Iekei*) ramen.  
The creamy pork and soy-based broth clings perfectly to their firm noodles.  
Toppings like spinach, nori, and boiled egg round out a rich, comforting bowl.  
A dash of garlic or their signature black bean sauce takes it over the top!

### 🦐 Tsukemen Gonokami Seisakusho

Shinjuku’s hidden gem specializes in seafood tsukemen (dipping noodles).  
Their shrimp-based broth is thick, fragrant, and unforgettable.  
Expect creative toppings like tomato and pesto if you’re feeling adventurous.  
Plan for a short wait—but it’s absolutely worth it.

### 🥩 Mǎzilù Lanzhou Beef Noodles

Want something a little different?  
Head to Jimbocho for traditional Lanzhou beef noodles.  
This halal shop offers nine noodle types and a beef broth so delicate yet rich you’ll want to savor every slurp.  
Certified by the Chinese government, it’s an authentic and unique experience right in Tokyo.
